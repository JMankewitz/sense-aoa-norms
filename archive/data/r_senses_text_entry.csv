Dear Participant,



 

This study is being conducted by Mahesh Srinivasan, assistant professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, and his laboratory of research assistants, graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows. We invite you to participate in a study exploring language and cognition in adulthood. Please read the following information carefully and sign this form if you wish to participate. Participation is entirely voluntary. If anything is not clear, please do not hesitate to ask questions.

 

Study Procedures

There will be 1 session, lasting no longer than 30 minutes. During this session, you will participate in experiments about language and cognition. We investigate a variety of topics including people’s knowledge of words and grammatical structures, and how this relates to their understanding of concepts (e.g., their knowledge of objects, substances, time, and number), and their ability to understand the intentions and goals of others (e.g., what other people believe and want). Additionally, we explore how these abilities are shaped by the environment in which people are raised, and thus explore how learning different languages affect how people think, and how culture influences people’s basic cognition (e.g., their moral reasoning, beliefs about themselves and others, and ability to learn from and share with others). Our research takes the form of short, interactive studies that are designed to be engaging.

 

You will participate in one or a combination of the following tasks: 

·         Language comprehension and production tasks (e.g., figuring out what language means and how it should be used)

·         General cognitive tasks (e.g., remembering things, controlling impulses)

·         Categorization/association tasks (e.g., sorting objects or stating what comes to mind given a prompt)

·         Search tasks (e.g., searching for or hiding objects, using maps/pictures)

·         Temporal reasoning tasks (e.g., estimating duration, placing events on a timeline)

·         Quantity tasks (e.g., estimating number of items, counting, deciding which set has more)

·         Morality/sharing tasks (e.g., making moral judgments, sharing resources with others)

·         Beliefs/attitudes tasks (e.g., expressing beliefs/attitudes about the world, yourself, and others)

·         Social group tasks (e.g., reasoning about individuals from different social groups)

·         Imitation tasks (e.g., imitating a presented action)

 

These studies may present you with a variety of objects, images, or videos, and ask you to answer questions or make judgments. In some studies, you will be asked to view images or watch videos on a computer screen. 

 

Benefits

You will not receive any direct benefits. However, you will be making a substantial contribution to improving our understanding of language and thought, and by placing children’s linguistic and cognitive development in context.

 

Risks/Discomforts

We do not expect you to face any foreseeable risks from your participation. However, there is the unlikely possibility that your confidentiality will be compromised but we have taken measures to minimize this risk. Usually, people enjoy participating in these studies, but if you would like to stop at any point, you can. 

 

Confidentiality

Your identity will be separated from your data and a numerical code will be assigned to keep track of the data transcriptions. Your confidentiality will be kept to the degree permitted by the technology being used. No guarantees can be made regarding the interception of data sent via the Internet by any third parties. Data will be kept indefinitely in case further analysis is required. All information collected during the research will be securely stored at the University in locked file cabinets and password-protected computers housed in secure rooms. Only laboratory personnel will have access to this data. No individuals will be identified in any presentation or publication.

 

Costs of Study Participation

There are no costs associated with study participation.

 

Compensation

For your participation in our research, you may receive course credit or money. If you are participating through the Research Participant Pool, you will receive a ½ course credit. If you are participating through Amazon’s Mturk, you will receive between $0.25 and $0.75 per task, depending on the time it takes to complete the type of task you’ve been assigned. If the task takes less than 10 minutes to complete, you will receive $0.25.  If the task takes between 10 and 20 minutes to complete, you will receive $0.50.  If the task takes between 20 and 30 minutes to complete, you will receive $0.75. Your online account will be credited directly. 
 

Alternatives to Participation

If you are participating through RPP, alternatives to participating in this research study are available to you. You may choose to participate in another RPP study or request a non-RPP alternative research assignment from your course instructor. Alternative assignments are estimated to be equivalent in terms of time and effort to participating in this study.

 

Rights

Please understand that your participation in the research is voluntary and that you are free to withdraw and discontinue participation in the research at any time. If you decide not to participate, there will be no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. Whether or not you participate in this study will have no bearing on your status with respect to any program, department, or service at the University of California, and will involve no adverse consequences to your school enrollment or coursework.
